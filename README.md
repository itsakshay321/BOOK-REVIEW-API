# Book Review API
Overview
This is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js for a basic Book Review system. It includes user authentication, book management, and review functionalities.

   ## Tech Stack
  	Node.js
  	Express.js
  	MongoDB (DB)
  	JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Authentication
## Features
	Authentication:
		User registration and login using JWT.
	Book Management:
		Add new books (protected).
		Retrieve all books with pagination and filtering.
		Retrieve a single book with details, average rating, and paginated reviews.
	Review Management:
		Submit reviews for books (protected, one review per user per book).
		Update/delete own reviews.
		Search
		Search books by title or author
## Database Schema	
### MongoDB Schema 
### 1. User Model
const mongoose = require('mongoose');


const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }
});


module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

### 2. Book Model
const mongoose = require('mongoose');


const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  author: String,
  genre: String,
  reviews: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Review' }]
});


module.exports = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);

### 3. Review Model
const mongoose = require('mongoose');


const reviewSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  book: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Book', required: true },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  comment: String
});


module.exports = mongoose.model('Review', reviewSchema);

# Project Setup 
Clone the repository:

npm install


## Set up environment variables:
In the .env file i created i just made MONGO_URI different change to your connection string after creating connection string from atlas
Run the application:
Node server.js

The server will start at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your .env file).

## Design Decisions & Assumptions
### Database
		We chose MongoDB because it handles JSON-like documents really well, which fits nicely with how most web APIs work. It also gives us flexibility when dealing with evolving data structures.
### Authentication
Authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Itâ€™s stateless, so it scales better and is relatively simple to implement. Tokens can be stored on the client and sent with each request, making session management easier.
